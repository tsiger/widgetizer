description: Widgetizer is free software licensed under GPL v3. Learn what you can do with it and what responsibilities come with using or modifying it.
---

Widgetizer is released under the **GNU General Public License version 3 (GPL v3)**. This page explains in plain English what that means for you as a user, developer, or organization.

# Your Rights

The GPL v3 license gives you significant freedoms:

### Use It Freely

- **Run Widgetizer for any purpose** — personal projects, commercial websites, non-profits, education, anything.
- **No usage fees or royalties** — it's completely free to use.
- **No registration or approval needed** — just download and start using it.

### Study and Modify

- **Access the complete source code** — you can see exactly how Widgetizer works.
- **Modify the code** — customize it, fix bugs, add features, or adapt it to your specific needs.
- **Use it privately** — if you modify Widgetizer for your own use and don't share it with others, you have no obligations beyond those of any user.

### Share and Distribute

- **Give copies to others** — share Widgetizer with friends, clients, or the public.
- **Charge money** — you can sell copies of Widgetizer or offer paid support services.
- **Include it in larger projects** — as long as you follow the license terms.

# Your Responsibilities

With these freedoms come some responsibilities, especially if you distribute Widgetizer (modified or not) to others:

### Keep It Open Source

- **Share your source code** — if you distribute a modified version of Widgetizer, you must also provide the source code to your recipients.
- **Use the same license** — any modified version you distribute must also be licensed under GPL v3. You cannot turn Widgetizer into proprietary software.
- **Include license notices** — keep the copyright and license information intact in the code.

### Be Transparent About Changes

- **Mark your modifications** — if you distribute a modified version, clearly indicate what you changed and when.
- **Don't misrepresent origins** — don't claim the original authors created your modifications.

### Respect Others' Freedom

- **Don't add restrictions** — you cannot impose additional terms that restrict what others can do with Widgetizer.
- **Provide installation info** — if you distribute Widgetizer in a device or product, you must provide the information needed for users to install modified versions.

# Common Scenarios

### "I just want to build websites with Widgetizer"

**No special obligations.** Use Widgetizer freely to create as many websites as you want. The sites you create are yours — the GPL doesn't apply to the websites you build, only to Widgetizer itself.

### "I want to modify Widgetizer for my own use"

**No special obligations** as long as you keep it private. You only have obligations if you share your modified version with others.

### "I want to share my modified version"

You'll need to:

- Provide the complete source code of your modified version
- License it under GPL v3
- Keep the original copyright notices
- Clearly document your changes

### "I want to use Widgetizer code in my commercial product"

You can do this, but your product (at least the parts derived from Widgetizer) must also be open source under GPL v3. This is sometimes called the "copyleft" aspect of the license.

### "I run a web design agency"

You can freely use Widgetizer to build websites for clients. The websites themselves are not covered by the GPL. If you create custom modifications to Widgetizer and distribute them (e.g., giving a modified copy to a client), those modifications must be open source.

# What's Not Covered

### Websites You Create

The GPL applies to Widgetizer the software, not to the websites you build with it. Your content, designs, and the sites you export belong to you.

### Third-Party Themes and Plugins

Themes and plugins may have their own licenses. Check their individual licensing terms.

### Warranty and Liability

Widgetizer is provided "as is" without warranty. The developers are not liable for any damages arising from its use. This is standard for open source software and protects contributors who generously share their work.
